# stats_final_project
Individual Final Project for the course "IDS702.01 Modeling and Representation of Data" at Duke University

About the project:  
Students should find their interested topics and datasets by themself and finish a analysis applying statistical model.  
For the requirement of the project in detail, please refer to "https://ids-702-f19.github.io/Course-Website/project/final-project.html"

Data source:  
The population data is from NHGIS, which is obtained directly from the U.S. Census.  
The cancer incidence numbers are downloaded from the CDC WONDER, which is originally provided by the United States Cancer Statistics that obtains the data from cancer registries.  
The data set which is used in this analysis is created by combining these two data sources on the state, year, age, race, and sex.
