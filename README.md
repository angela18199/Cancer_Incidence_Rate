# Cancer Incidence Rate
Individual Final Project for the course "IDS702.01 Modeling and Representation of Data" at Duke University.
Students should find their interested topics and datasets by themself and finish a analysis applying statistical model.  

- IDE: R studio
- Language: R
- Data source: NHGIS/ CDC WONDER
    - The population data is from NHGIS, which is obtained directly from the U.S. Census.  
    - The cancer incidence numbers are downloaded from the CDC WONDER, which is originally provided by the United States Cancer Statistics that obtains the data from cancer registries.  
    - The data set which is used in this analysis is created by combining these two data sources on the state, year, age, race, and sex.
